After years as a Graphic Designer/Web Designer, I then transitioned to the UX Design process. HTML5 and CSS3 became part of my everyday workload as I developed cross-platform responsive websites; but then JavaScript/Typescript, jQuery, Angular, and React kept creeping into my work in small doses. As a result, this hybrid makes me a stronger asset to a team; because, in addition to approaching the design process with an understanding of how my design will be later developed; after the design assets are handed off to the development team, Iâ€™m able to check out a source control (i.e. Git) branch and help the developers with the CSS and even some basic app architecture, app components or other small portions of the code. I also have working experience with the Agile/Scrum development process.';
